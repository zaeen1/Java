Welcome to my Java assignments repository! 
Inside, you will discover a collection of completed projects designed for educational use. 
While I hope you find the code informative and helpful, please remember that I can not take responsibility for any unexpected outcomes, loss, or issues that might arise from using it. 
If you decide to incorporate any part of my code, I encourage you to personalize it to suit your unique needs, and remember to proceed with caution. 
Happy coding!
